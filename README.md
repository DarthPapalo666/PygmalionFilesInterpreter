# PygmalionFilesInterpreter
PFI (Pygmalion Files Interpreter) can read different types of files from exported chats involved with PygmalionAI.

It is developed in Godot, feel free to download and make any changes as you wish.
I will keep updating it until a fully usable and stable version is available.

Current features:
 - Export a chat to several images (Main feature)
 - Export a chat file (.jsonl, .json) into a plain .txt file.
 - Currently 2 UI's are available for export: TavernAI (KoboldAI), Gradio.

Planned features:
 - Edit and create embedded .png character files (For TavernUI)
 - Full customization of image exporting.

Any feedback or requests are welcomed.
