# PygmalionFilesInterpreter
PFI (Pygmalion Files Interpreter) can read different types of files from exported chats or characters involved with PygmalionAI.

It is developed in Godot, feel free to download and make any changes as you wish.
I will keep updating it until a fully usable and stable version is available.
